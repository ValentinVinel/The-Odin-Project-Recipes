    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>As the old joke goes, it takes a lot of time and effort to make poutine, but at least when you're finally done you get to eat soggy fries. And, what incredibly delicious, soggy fries they are. While I don't have any problem with you buying the cheese curds, or using frozen fries, I do hope you make the sauce from scratch. Use beef chuck, short rib, or brisket to achieve this marvelously meaty, super savory, ridiculously rich gravy that makes all the sogginess worth it.</p>
    <p>Feel free to substitute lard for the oil and use any kind of broth you prefer.</p>
    <p>If you're of the vegetarian persuasion, some severely caramelized mushrooms and a decent vegetable stock will produce a perfectly fine version.</p>
